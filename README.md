# PyBer_Analysis

PyBer Analysis using Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib Library
## Overview of the PyBer analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine total weekly fares to understand how the weekly fare differs by each city type and the analysis also help determine how the differences in weekly fare can be used by decision makers at PyBer.

## Results:
Based on the car ride data for first 5 months of the 2019 below are the result by the city type. Further analysis can be done by each cities in different city type to determine which cities in each city types are performing good and worse. Moreover, based on the analysis, it can also be determined on what cities require more drivers and which cities have more drivers than required based on the number of rides per month.
### Urban City Type
The Urban cities has the most number of rides that is counted to 1625. It also has most number of drivers and total fare. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver is lowest for Urban cities compared to cities of other type. 

### Suburban City Type
The Suburban cities has the second most number of rides (625) and number of drivers (490). The average fare per ride is more than Urban cities but less than rural cities. The total fare earned by drivers in Suburban city ($19,356.33) is almost half of what the Urban city drivers earned ($39,854.38) but the Average fare per driver is more than double for suburban city drivers ($39.50) compared to the urban city drivers ($16.57).

### Rural City Type
The rural cities has the least number of rides (125) and drivers (78) compared to Urban and Suburban cities. Because of the high total rides to total driver ratio, the average fare per drivers ($55.49) is significantly higher than cities of other types. 

## Summary
This section provides recoomandation based o the analysis done on PyBer ride data.
1) Urban cities has more drivers than rides taken in last 5 months. PyBer should look into number of driver for each urban city and reducing the number of drivers to allow fair distribution of ride per driver
2) Rural cities least number of rides recorded. It is recommanded that more advertisement can be done in these cities to improve the number and eventually get more drivers on the road. 
3) Suburban cities ride count can be improved by more advertisements and getting more drivers on the road
